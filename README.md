## ⌨️ (01:31) What is Prompt Engineering?

Involves human writing, refining and optimizing prompts in a structured way. This is done with the intention of perfecting the interaction between human and AI to the highest degree possible.

Prompt Engineering

- write, refine and optimize prompts
- perfect the interaction between humans and AI
- continuously monitor those prompts
- maintain an up to date prompt library

## ⌨️ (02:17) Introduction to AI

Artificial Intelligence is the *simulation* of human intelligence processes by machines. Simulation means that AI is not sentient, at least not yet. It cannot think for itself.

Machine learning - feeding training data to machines.

## ⌨️ (03:52) Why is Machine learning useful?

Example

Prompt: I want you to act as a spoken English teacher. I will speak to you in English and you'll reply to me in English to practice my spoken English. I want you to keep my reply neat, limiting the reply to 100 words. I also want you to strictly correct my grammar mistakes and typos. And I want you to ask me a question in your reply. Now, let's start practicing. You could ask me a question first. Remember, I want you to strictly correct my grammar mistakes and typos. 

GPT-4: Of course! I'm ready to assist you with your spoken English. Here's your first question: "What hobbies do you have and why do you enjoy them?" Remember to answer in English, and I'll provide corrections if needed.

- way more interactive
- communicating with the AI
- completely different experience based on the prompt we wrote
